# House Price Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on key features. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Problem Statement
Accurately predicting house prices is a common real-world regression problem. The goal of this project is to build a reliable predictive model using historical housing data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Machine Learning Workflow
